# Wavelet-based-Watermarking-and-reconstruction-of-image-from-salt-and-pepper-noise-attack

This is my university research topic. It implements a wavelet based watermarking and reconstruct the noisy image from salt and pepper noise attack.

I implemented  an adaptive median filter of maximum of 7*7 window to remove the noise, which works better than other existing filter to remove salt and pepper noise.
